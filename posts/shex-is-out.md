The front page of Stellar HEX demo is now available [here](https://aim-753.pages.dev/shex). All its links are yet incorrect, but I hope the wording will not change much. Speaking of its style, I borrowed it from the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - with thanks! And I chose to use CSS Modules instead of Styled JSX.
