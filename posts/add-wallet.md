title: 'Add Stellar Wallet to Your Browser'

I did my best, as a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) rookie, to help my Stellar HEX Demo user to add the non-custodial Stellar wallet - [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) - to her browser right from the demo. And it seemed to be working fine locally with `npm run dev`. Not so [for you](https://aim-753.pages.dev/shex-join), I'm afraid. So please, before you ever consider running my demo, add [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) to your browser, set it up and add an account.
